# Student Evaluation Tool
> Final personal assignment made for Codaisseur

The goal of this to make a tool which could be used to manage classes and students and evaluate them.
We were also asked to make an algorithm that would fetch a student to ask a question to, students with the lowest scores would get questions more often.

I used OneToMany and ManyToOne relations for the TypeOrm database which then gives you the benefit of getting linked data with a single @Get. Setting it up was quite a challenge though!

### With the endproduct a user could:

* Add and remove classes
* Add and remove students
* View student score colors and comments
